# ScheduleMonkey

## About
This is going to be a basic online scheduling tool primarily for students to plan their weeks. 

## Why
I think it's important to keep up on the basics of software development and to learn new things along the way. This is a simple application in theory, but follow the steps to release a solid functioning app is more difficult than it sounds. This will require databasing, front end design, and sketching (UI diagrams, ER models, ect.). Also, this type of stuff isn't necessarily covered in my course work so I am going to be expirimenting with things I have not used before.

## Preliminaries
I'm attaching a simple ER diagram below so other students might get an idea of what goes into a simple application like this. I'm sure it can be improved but this gist of it is captured here. I used the open source modeling program DIA to design this:

## Tools [tentative]
1. Frameworks: React.js (potentially django) I might host this on AWS so that may change things
2. Frontend: JS, CSS, HTML
2. Backend: sqllite
